 # GrandPrix

GrandPrix is a package for non-linear probabilistic dimension reduction algorithm in python, using [TensorFlow](github.com/tensorflow) and [GPFlow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow). GrandPrix uses sparse variational approximation to project data to lower dimensional spaces. The model is described in the paper

["GrandPrix: Scaling up the Bayesian GPLVM for single-cell data.", 
Sumon Ahmed, Magnus Rattray and Alexis Boukouvalas, Bioinformatics, Volume 35, Issue 1, 01 January 2019, Pages 47â€“54.](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty533)

To replicate the results in the paper please use the [`betaVersion`](https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GrandPrix/tree/betaVersion) branch. The [`master`](https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GrandPrix/tree/master) branch works with the latest version of `GPflow`.

`N.B.` The package contains several large data files which are needed to run the example notebooks. Please be sure that your system has [Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)](https://help.github.com/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage/#platform-mac) installed to download these large data files.  

## Installation
If you have any problems with installation see the script at the bottom of the page for a detailed setup guide from a new python environment. 

   - Install tensorflow
```
pip install tensorflow
```
   - Install GPflow
```
git clone https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow.git
cd GPflow    
pip install .
cd
```
    
See [GPFlow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow) page for more detailed instructions.

   - Install GrandPrix package
```
git clone https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GrandPrix
cd GrandPrix
python setup.py install
cd
```

## Running in a cluster
When running GrandPrix in a cluster it may be useful to constrain the number of cores used. To do this insert this code at the beginning of your script.
```
from gpflow import settings
settings.session.intra_op_parallelism_threads = NUMCORES
settings.session.inter_op_parallelism_threads = NUMCORES
```
